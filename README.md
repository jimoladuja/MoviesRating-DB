# MovieRating DB - SQL Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves the design and analysis of a relational database for a movie rating system. The goal was to manage user data, movie metadata, and rating transactions to derive insights into user preferences and content performance.

The database consists of three main tables:
- **Users:** Demographic data (Name, Age, Gender, Location) for 20 users.
- **Movies:** Metadata (Title, Genre, Release Year, Director) for 20 movies.
- **Ratings:** Transactional data linking users to movies with a rating score (1-5) and date.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **SQL (PostgreSQL):** For database creation, data manipulation, and querying.
- **Data Analysis:** Aggregate functions, Joins, and Filtering.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Top Content:** *Oppenheimer* is the highest-rated movie (4.8/5).
- **Genre Trends:** Biography and Adventure movies perform best on average.
- **Demographics:** The user base is perfectly split between males and females, with Lagos being the top location.

## 🚀 Recommendations
